## Grocery item image recognition using a custom dataset

This repository contains the materials accompanying my Capstone project for the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree:
- `Notebooks` folder contains all the code:
    * `Code`: entire codeset, as well as output 
    * `Merge`: code to combine and clean datasets
    * `Transform`: code to process custom dataset and transform images
    * `Train`: code to build and train model
    * `Test`: code to test accuracy of entire model, and of each class
    
- `Datasets` folder contains datasets used for this project, which can also be downladed here:
    * Fruits 360 dataset: [https://github.com/Horea94/Fruit-Images-Dataset](https://github.com/Horea94/Fruit-Images-Dataset)
    * Freiberg Grocery dataset: [https://github.com/PhilJd/freiburg_groceries_dataset](https://github.com/PhilJd/freiburg_groceries_dataset)

- `Report` folder contains technical write-up of the project
